# Glacier_Mass_Balance_Model_MATLAB

This is model for finding out the amount of water that is melting from the glacier as runoff due to increase in pollution in our Himalayan Glaciers. The main model used here to calculate the runoff is Glacier Mass Balance Model taken from Fujita et al., 2000. and this was implemented in MATLAB
