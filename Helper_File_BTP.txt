There are 2 different files for 2 different outputs.

1.Specific_Input_and_Specific_Output.m :-

This file is used to get the value of specific run off and surface temperature of glacier for a specific value of albedo.
This also gives the variation of snow and ice temperatures with depth into the glacier and during the duration of observation.
Input - Albedo
Output - Runoff, plots of temperature of snowlayer and ice layer with depth and duration of observation.

2.Sensitivity_output_code.m :- 

This file is for the sensitivity analysis of the model by varying albedo.
Here the variation of surface temperature of glacier and runoff for different values of albedo is obtained.
Also sensitivity plots of Runoff and Surface temperature vs albedo are obtained.
Albedo varies from 1 (pure snow) to 0.5 (extremely polluted snow)
Output - Sensitivity plots ie, Surface temperature vs Albedo and Runoff vs Albedo

Both the files have same code with very slight changes which lead to different outputs.

The model which is coded here is taken from Fujita and Ageta paper- Glacier Mass Balance model.

%--------------------------------Flow of the code--------------------------------%
Albedo is the main input to the code. Through the heat balance equation, mass of melted ice, Hg and Ts are found iteratively in a loop until the difference of surface temperatures of 2 loops is less than 0.01 degree celcius.
After loop is terminated, we get the final surface temperature, mass balance equation is used to find if any water is refrozen based on the obtained surface temperature. Also the precipitation- rainfall and snowfall are also computed.
Then from all the obtained values - mass of melted ice, precipitation and refrozen water, runoff is found.
Also the variation of temperature with depth of glacier and duration of observation time are plotted.
These values of surface temperature and runoff are obtained for different values of albedo.
